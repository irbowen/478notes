## Multi Level Synthesis

We apply various "transformations" to boolean networks, such as
- decomposition
- substituion
- factoring

with the goal being to find good factored forms

## Terms

- Algebraic Expression: an expression in which no cube contains another cube
  - a + bc is
  - a + ab is not
