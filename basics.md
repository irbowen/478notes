## Basics
- PMOS and NMOS transistors have voltages applied to them that are not interchangeable. Only PMOS transistors can be used in the pull up circuit, and only NMOS transistors can be used in the pull down circuit.

## Terms you should know
- Gate

## Sets, Relations, Partial Orderings, Lattices
- Set
  - A collection of elements
- Relation
  - A mapping of ordered pairs

#### Properties
- Reflexive
  - R is reflexive if a R a for every a in A
- Symmetric
  - R is symmetric if a R b implies that b R a
- Antisymmetric
  - R is antisymmetric if a R b and b R a implies that a = b
  - Not the same as not symmetric
- Transitive
  - R is transitive if a R b and b R c implies that a R c
- **Compatibility Relation** - Reflexive and Symmetric
  - Need not be transitive
- **Equivalence Relation** - Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive
  - \# (pi): number of blocks
  - p (pi): number of elements in largest block
  - Subset of the Compatibility Relation

#### Partial Orderings
#### Partial Ordered Sets
#### Lattices
#### Boolean Algebra
